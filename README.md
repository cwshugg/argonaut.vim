# Argonaut

Argonaut is a Vim plugin that gives Vim scripts and plugin developers a simple,
yet powerful interface to create and parse custom command-line arguments for
Vim commands. It provides:

* A clean interface for building and parsing custom command arguments.
* Support for in-line shell command execution, vim command execution, and
  environment variable retrieval.
* Rich tab-completion support that auto-completes your custom arguments, file
  paths, environment variable names, etc.
